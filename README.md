There are two separate species of dot- yellow and purple- that start in two different locations in each generation, whose goal is to reach a food source. There is also a predator species with its own starting point. The yellow/purple fitness is calculated by their proximity to the food and their surivability, and the predators' are calculated by how many yellow/purples they eat. Reproduction is asexual with mutations. The continued evolution after many generations is very interesting to watch.
